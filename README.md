# ActionPi
Raspberry Pi-based action cameras.

## Pinout
Coming soon.

## Installation
Currently, the best way to install ActionPi is to add **camera.py** to an easily accessible directory, and then edit **rc.local** to add the line 
"sudo python /[FILEPATH]/camera.py &" (without quotes) before the **exit 0** command.  This will run **camera.py** at boot.
