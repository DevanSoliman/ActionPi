# ActionPi
Raspberry Pi-based action cameras.

## Installation
Currently, the easiest way to install **ActionPi** on **Raspberry Pi OS** is to add `camera.py` to an easily accessible directory, and then add line `sudo python /[FILEPATH]/camera.py &` to `rc.local` before the `exit 0` command.  This will run `camera.py` as a background process after bootup. 

## 3D Printing
I recommend using a filament with impact, UV, and fatigue resistance.  A high wall count and/or a high infill percentage are necessary for strength.
Prototype printed in PETG with wall line count of 4.

## Pinout
Coming soon.
